*************************create server and request and fetch*************************

1. To create own server we need http node js package
    and with the help of this we can build server 
    syntax:
         import http from 'http'
      const myserver=  http.createServer() //this the function used to create request.it takes callbackfunction
          http.createServer( (req,res)=>{
            //this function takes two parameters:if any external req or res will come it will handle them
            //1. request: if req comes, all client side meta data stores here.
            //2. response: if we want to send any request with the help of res.

            res.end('hello this is my first response!');
          })

          2.To run this server we need one port (4000/3000/8000):
            myserver.listen(8000, ()=>{
              console.log("server Started")
            })
# We use the http.createServer method to create the server.
# The request listener function has the correct signature with req and res parameters.
# We set the response headers using res.writeHead.
# We send the response using res.end.


//////req////#" its object that contains a lot info "
it contains many object 
1.headers: contain all info about client/sender/user.

*************exmple*****************
const http = require("http");

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  console.log(req.headers)
  res.end("Hello this is my first http request!");
});

server.listen(8000, () => {
  console.log("listening from server 8000");
});
